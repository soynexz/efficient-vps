# Efficient VPS

Hosting a server is not too expensive but if you are not using it always it's a waste of money for you and a waste of resources for the hosting (not like they care though).

This project contains files and code from [toolbisoftware/api](https://github.com/toolbisoftware/api) since I made it myself too and it's a waste of time to write the exact same thing that already works fine.

## What does this?

Basically, it allows users to log-in with a Discord account. If the user is allowed into the dashboard it can turn on and off the server and manage some settings.

## Components

- API: ExpressJS (TypeScript)
- Website: NextJS (TypeScript)
